# Default: clamav
#DatabaseOwner clamav

# This option defined how many times daily freshclam should check for
# a database update.
# Default: 12
Checks 24

# Use DNS to verify the virus database version. Freshclam uses DNS TXT records
# to verify the versions of the database and software itself. With this
# directive you can change the database verification domain.
# WARNING: Please don't change it unless you're configuring freshclam to use
# your own database verification domain.
# Default: current.cvd.clamav.net
#DNSDatabaseInfo current.cvd.clamav.net

# DatabaseMirror specifies to which mirror(s) freshclam should connect.
# You should have at least two entries: db.XY.clamav.net (or db.XY.ipv6.clamav.net
# for IPv6) and database.clamav.net (in this order). Please replace XY with your
# country code (see http://www.iana.org/cctld/cctld-whois.htm).
# database.clamav.net is a round-robin record which points to our most reliable
# mirrors. It's used as a fall back in case db.XY.clamav.net is not working.
# Default: disabled
#DatabaseMirror db.XY.clamav.net
DatabaseMirror db.fr.clamav.net
DatabaseMirror database.clamav.net

# This option allows you to easily point freshclam to private mirrors.
# If PrivateMirror is set, freshclam does not attempt to use DNS
# to determine whether its databases are out-of-date, instead it will
# use the If-Modified-Since request or directly check the headers of the
# remote database files. For each database, freshclam first attempts
# to download the CLD file. If that fails, it tries to download the
# CVD file. This option overrides DatabaseMirror, DNSDatabaseInfo
# and Scripted Updates. It can be used multiple times to provide
# fall-back mirrors.
# Default: disabled
#PrivateMirror mirror1.mynetwork.com
#PrivateMirror mirror2.mynetwork.com

# This option defines how many attempts freshclam should make before giving up.
# Default: 3
MaxAttempts 5

# With this option you can control scripted updates. It's highly recommended to keep them enabled.
# Default: yes
#ScriptedUpdates yes

# With this option enabled, freshclam will attempt to load new
# databases into memory to make sure they are properly handled
# by libclamav before replacing the old ones.
# Default: yes
#TestDatabases yes

# By default freshclam will keep the local databases (.cld) uncompressed to
# make their handling faster. With this option you can enable the compression.
# The change will take effect with the next database update.
# Default: no
#CompressLocalDatabase 

# Download an additional 3rd party signature database distributed through
# the ClamAV mirrors. This option can be used multiple times.
# Here you can find a list of available databases:
# http://www.clamav.net/download/cvd/3rdparty

#ExtraDatabase dbname1
#ExtraDatabase dbname2

# With this option you can provide custom sources (http:// or file://) for database files.
# This option can be used multiple times.

# If your servers are behind a firewall/proxy which does a User-Agent
# filtering you can use this option to force the use of a different
# User-Agent header.
# Default: disabled
#HTTPUserAgent default

# Send the RELOAD command to clamd after a successful update.
# Default: /etc/clamav/clamd.conf

# With this option you can provide a client address for the database downlading.
# Useful for multi-homed systems.
# Default: disabled

# Default: 30
#ReceiveTimeout 30

# When enabled freshclam will submit statistics to the ClamAV Project about
# the latest virus detections in your environment. The ClamAV maintainers
# will then use this data to determine what types of malware are the most
# detected in the field and in what geographic area they are.
# Freshclam will connect to clamd in order to get recent statistics.
# Default: disabled
#SubmitDetectionStats /path/to/clamd.conf

# Country of origin of malware/detection statistics (for statistical
# purposes only). The statistics collector at ClamAV.net will look up
# your IP address to determine the geographical origin of the malware
# reported by your installation. If this installation is mainly used to
# scan data which comes from a different location, please enable this
# option and enter a two-letter code (see http://www.iana.org/domains/root/db/)
# of the country of origin.
# Default: disabled
#DetectionStatsCountry country-code

# This option enables support for our "Personal Statistics" service.
# When this option is enabled, the information on malware detected by
# your clamd installation is made available to you through our website.
# To get your HostID, log on http://www.stats.clamav.net and add a new
# host to your host list. Once you have the HostID, uncomment this option
# and paste the HostID here. As soon as your freshclam starts submitting
# information to our stats collecting service, you will be able to view
# the statistics of this clamd installation by logging into
# http://www.stats.clamav.net with the same credentials you used to
# generate the HostID. For more information refer to:
# http://www.clamav.net/doc/cctts.html
# This feature requires SubmitDetectionStats to be enabled.
# Default: disabled
#DetectionStatsHostID unique-id

# This option enables support for Google Safe Browsing. When activated for
# the first time, freshclam will download a new database file (safebrowsing.cvd)
# which will be automatically loaded by clamd and clamscan during the next
# reload, provided that the heuristic phishing detection is turned on. This
# database includes information about websites that may be phishing sites or
# possible sources of malware. When using this option, it's mandatory to run
# freshclam at least every 30 minutes.
# Freshclam uses the ClamAV's mirror infrastructure to distribute the
# database and its updates but all the contents are provided under Google's
# terms of use. See http://www.google.com/transparencyreport/safebrowsing
# and http://www.clamav.net/doc/safebrowsing.html for more information.
# Default: no
#SafeBrowsing yes

# This option enables downloading of bytecode.cvd, which includes additional
# detection mechanisms and improvements to the ClamAV engine.
# Default: yes
#Bytecode yes
